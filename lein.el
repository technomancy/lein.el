;;; lein.el --- Eshell interface to Leiningen

;; Copyright Â© 2013 Phil Hagelberg

;; Author: Phil Hagelberg
;; URL: https://github.com/technomancy/lein.el
;; Version: 0.1
;; Created: 2013-01-26
;; Keywords: tools, convenience
;; Package-Requires: ((nrepl "0.1.7"))

;; This file is NOT part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; This provides an eshell interface to the Leiningen project
;; automation tool for Clojure. (http://leiningen.org) It communicates
;; over nREPL (https://github.com/kingtim/nrepl.el) to avoid starting
;; a new process for every command. Note that tasks which call
;; eval-in-project will still start a project JVM; it's only
;; Leiningen's own startup time which is avoided.

;;; Usage

;; Currently you need to launch Leiningen once per Emacs instance with
;; M-x lein-launch. Then start eshell with M-x eshell and use
;; Leiningen as you would normally.
